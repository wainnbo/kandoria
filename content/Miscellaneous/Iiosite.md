Iiosite is a rare and precious mineral found throughout the world of Kandoria. It is the crystalized flesh of dead gods killed during the [[Birth of Chaos]].



Testing for fake iiosite is a simple but resource-intensive process. To determine a piece of iiosite's authenticity, it must be put under extreme pressure and heat and survive without melting. This can usually be done with a large furnace and a specially resistant steel shell to house the mineral in question.
