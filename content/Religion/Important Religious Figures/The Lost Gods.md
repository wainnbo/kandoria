## *"Reveal yourselves, o distant Gods lost to time, for chaos is returning to our world. Only by your good graces may we yet endure."*
## *â€”A carving found in a [[Persistents|Persistent]] Originist dungeon*

The Lost Gods are a proposed group of Gods that survived the [[Birth of Chaos]], but aren't known to Kandoria. Since they're unknown to the planet, there's no physical evidence of their existence. However, significant anecdotes have attracted attention over time, resulting in small and scattered heretical sects of [[Originism]] that preach the minimally understood lore of the Lost Gods.
