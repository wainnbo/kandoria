## *"Skipping joyfully alongside the mighty Mikkeron was Beau. Though he had the appearance of a lamb, radiant powers eminated from his milk white fleece. The creature itself could not speak, but carried with it the wisdom of eons and the purity of clear water."*
## *â€”[[The Epic of Creation|Stories Before Time 2:14]]*

Beau, the Blessed was an original companion of [[Mikkeron, the Progenitor God|Mikkeron]]. Beau appeared as a small lamb and journeyed with Mikkeron throughout the realm in the earliest days of Kandoria's existence as a part of the [[Alagarian Crusade]]. Though it has never been fully specified, Beau is believed to have existed since the [[Birth of Chaos]] at the latest, living with Mikkeron until [[The Sacrifice]]. Though not a god by traditional measures, Beau's flesh and blood matched that of a god, and some sects of [[Originism]] worship him as such. 

Beau was eventually destroyed in The Sacrifice in exchange for Kandoria's protection against the [[Hounds of Chaos]].
