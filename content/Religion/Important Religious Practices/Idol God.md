An Idol God is the most prominent God in a given religion. Often times Idol Gods have literal idols constructed in their image, but this is far from a requirement to be called one. For example, in [[Originism|Originist]] belief, [[Mikkeron, the Progenitor God|Mikkeron]] would be considered the Idol God. Similarly, members of the [[Ivor March]] would consider [[Maveline, Goddess of the Dead|Maveline]] to be their Idol God.
