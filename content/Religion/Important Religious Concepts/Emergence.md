The Emergence was a short-lived false theological explanation for how existence came into being. Popularized and created by [[Mikkeron, the Progenitor God|Mikkeron]] Himself, the Emergence was the story told to [[Alagar|Alagarian]] mortals during the [[Alagarian Crusade]], rather than the modern accepted line of events in the [[Birth of Chaos]]. The version of events according to the Emergence goes as follows:

- Before there was anything, there was the Great Nothing, a box-shaped space of nonexistence that antithetically contained Mikkeron.
- Mikkeron, furiously trying to escape this box, created children, once again, out of nothing. These children were all of the rest of the gods.
- Through the gods' combined strength, they broke open the walls of the Great Nothing, unleashing [[Iiosite]] (originally, and incorrectly, explained to be a sort of omnipresent magical force existing in all space)
- [[Kosmé, Goddess of the World|Kosmé]] used the "forces" of Iiosite to create matter and arrange it into the planet of [[Kandoria]].
- With the gods' help, mortalkind quickly developed civilization, including law, towns, and farming, among other foundational things.

The Emergence was originally told as the [[Divine Lie]] to protect mortalkind from the existential cosmic horror of the universe.

Though the events of the Emergence are false, its impact still lives on in Alagar, most notably in their chronological suffix of P.E. (Post Emergence) rather than B.C. (Birth of Chaos).
