The Divine Lie is a religious concept directly involving the nation of [[Alagar]]. When [[Mikkeron, the Progenitor God|Mikkeron]] began the [[Alagarian Crusade]], He originally described the [[Emergence]], a much more simplified history of the universe, as the true creation of all things, rather than the [[Birth of Chaos]], and all of the existential dangers that come with it. The Divine Lie was uncovered in the aftermath of [[The Sacrifice]], when the [[Hounds of Chaos]] consumed [[Beau, the Blessed|Beau]]. Mikkeron neglected to mention the true story because, in his words, "Mortals shan't be made to bear witness to the existential horrors of the cosmos" (*[[The Epic of Creation|All the Days Left 3:4]]*). Though this move offended some, it's become very commonplace in religious circles, most notably [[Originism]], to see the Divine Lie for what Mikkeron said it was, a veiled attempt at easing the minds of mortals. Because of the Divine Lie, Alagar still continues to use P.E. (Post Emergence) as its chronological suffix, rather than the otherwise universally accepted B.C. (Birth of Chaos).
