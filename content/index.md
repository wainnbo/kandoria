## Thanks for checking this out!
This site is still very much a work in progress, but I hope that over time as I learn exactly what I'm doing that it'll turn into a massive hub for all things related to my custom D&D setting: Kandoria. I want to take a second to appreciate your interest in my world building because I know there's a shit ton of stuff on here. All I can ask is that you don't get turned off just because of how much there is. I made this to organize my own data but also so that my players get to know my world. If you have any ideas on ways to make this more beginner friendly let me know!

Also, I hope to relearn a lot of web programming stuff so I can make the place look nicer than just generic text on a gray background. Until then I hope you find whatever info you're looking for, and check the section below for quick links to get you started if you have no idea what you're doing here.
