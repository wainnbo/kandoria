Tyrant and Tybalt were the brother kings of, and founders of, [[Shoresmouth|Shorenth]]. The two were born on [[Lirthos]] as some of the first humanoids to exist in the realm, likely sometime close to 1 [[Birth of Chaos|B.C.]], though an exact date is unknown. Due to a highly distorted sense of time, the brothers believed that they were actually born 6,000 years ago, rather than the more realistic estimate of ~800 years. For at least 200 years, Tyrant and Tybalt have been trapped inside of the [[Crown of Ashes]], an ancient Shorenthian/Lirthosian relic.
