#### *"His body stands rigid like a lustrous mountain. A long wispy beard floats aimlessly about, even against the harshest of cyclones. Long hair spills out of His scalp like water. Ghostly white eyes seem to look both at you, and through you. Despite this, He is beyond mortal description, as each glance seems to change His form."*
#### *â€”[[Jarral, the Original Cleric]]*
