The Season of Dust is a uniquely [[Alagar|Alagarian]] season that replaces the [[Seasons|Season of the Moon]]. The Season of Dust is caused by a predictable yearly series of dust storms created by high northbound winds originating south of the [[Crest of Kolasir]]. Because the season is specifically caused by dust storms pushed north of the Crest of Kolasir, it is celebrated solely by Alagar, and it fittingly replaces the Season of the Moon both due to timing and the fact that the Moon is often visibly blocked out by the dust storms.
