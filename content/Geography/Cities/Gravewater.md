Gravewater (originally Goodwater) is a mostly abandoned milling and mining town located about 10 miles northeast of the [[Fijor|Fijoran]] capital [[Clairoux]]. Much of the town left in 698 [[Time|B.C.]] after a mining explosion released dangerous natural gases that both poisoned the air in the immediate vicinity, and leaked waste into the town's underground well water, killing residents who drank it. This event and the poisoning of the well led to the initially colloquial change of the town's name to Gravewater. Within a year, the new name became more common than the old, and in modern times the original name of the town is considered lost to history.
