In Kandoria, when a humanoid dies and their body decays, their material corpse disintegrates over time into salts; rose-colored, tiny crystals, about 1/10 of an inch in length. Outside of color and size, it is completely identical to real life salt. Its taste and texture is the same.

A body decomposes into salts, pretty similarly to real life human bodies do. In optimal conditions for decomposition, it can take as little as 10 days for a corpse to turn to salts after the moment of death, however it usually takes an average of about 2 weeks, unless the body is buried, in which case it can take as much as a year.

One notable distinction in the process of decomposition is if the deceased was killed by magic, in which case a body turns to salts in minutes, sometimes instantly.

Another thing worth noting is that skeletons are separate from salts, so a corpse still leaves a skeleton behind after it is finished decomposing.

Salts are very valuable tools for any sort of forensics, as skilled crystallographers can make accurate conclusions about the nature of one's demise with only a single salt crystal. Even without a crystallographer, a bit of experience and intuition can allow anybody to make roughly correct judgements about a time of death just by looking at the body and the amount of salts with it at the time.

In religious contexts, salts are sometimes believed to be related to a being's soul, and it's common for family members to spread them at significant locations, much like a person's ashes in real life.
