The Redlocke Family are a famous noble house, mainly located in [[Cairoux]], the largest city in [[Fijor]]. 

The Redlockes are notable for many reasons, but they're perhaps most known for their naturally flame-colored hair, supposedly a generations-old genetic mutation unique to the family. It's assumed that the flame hair genetics are highly dominant, as it's incredibly hard to remove, even from children deep into the history of the family.

Beyond their unique hair color, the Redlockes are also known for their history of economic power and political influence. Numerous Redlockes have served as Fijor's premier and even more have served as Cairoux's mayor. Even when a family member doesn't actively hold office, their influence is typically still felt politically, as they develop deep connections with those in power. Interestingly, Cairoux's current mayor, Ruban Bendewald, has been said to have completely isolated himself from any Redlocke tampering, leading to unrest between the powerful family and the city's current government.
